__Purpose:__   
Testing ECP-based applications often take quite some effort for setup and preparation.  
I have created a Docker-based workbench that allows you to have it quick at hands.  
And if you crash it? You just give your containers a fresh start.  
The whole setup runs code-based during the start-up of your instance.  
In that sense, it is also a portable coding example using ZPM and the objectscript-docker-template  
  
It's a fast setup of ECP client / server with almost no manual intervention  
with everything included in the repository available from OEX.  
_Except:_   
As the default community-license doesn't include multi-server-features (ECP) you might 
have to use your own license or get a temporary loan license from WRC that you add to  
the downloaded set from GitHub as __ECP_iris.key__ before starting.   

__Installation:__  
From terminal/command prompt  in the download directory run  
~~~
      docker-compose build 
~~~
And it will prepare __2__ containers for __ECPserver__ and __ECPclient.__   
They are pretty much the same except that they get a hostname: server and client   
This allows communication between the containers based on network names  
instead of dynamic (and unpredictable) DHCP addresses.  
The internal ports for external access as SMP, ... _1972,52773,53773_ are published to  
_41773,42773,43773_ for the server and _41443,42443,43443_ for the client  

Next, you launch both containers  by   
~~~
      docker-compose up -d server
      docker-compose up -d client  
~~~
Don't start containers together but in sequence, as it may take some time until  
the whole configuration completes [only during the first startup] of the container.   
For a simple reason I had to learn:   
The final hostname is not available in the temporary containers during the build!  
And there is obviously a difference!  
  
In addition, the client can only connect when the server finished startup. 
I experienced up to 120 sec until ECP was running stable and both startups completed.  
  
Impatient people (as me) meanwhile watch the progress by  
~~~
      docker logs <containername>   
~~~
It is exactly the output you see in messages.log   

__Testing:__
You may either open a session to server or client by
~~~
      docker-compose exec server iris session iris
      docker-compose exec client iris session iris
~~~
or you use SMP at local ports 42773 or 42443   

__Test data:__  
In namespace USER Code and Data are stored in separated databases:   
Code (Classes) are in database USER in both containers.   
Data are stored in the database  IRISLOCALDATA on the server  
On the client, data from the same database are used as __RemoteDatabase over ECP__   

Classes and test data are borrowed from SAMPLES in Cach√© and preloaded.  
- Sample.Address  
- Sample.Company  
- Sample.Customer  
- Sample.Employee  
- Sample.Person  
- Sample.USZipCode  
- Sample.Utils  
- Sample.Vendor  

So trying, testing, extending, screwing this workbench by  
__your own__ Classes, Tables, Data, Queries are ready to go.
